# ZooSimulation / ContagionSimulation 4.2
Updated version of the ZooSimulation for AP Computer Science to model contagion spread

Note: The user interface for this simulation was built using the BreezyGUI package developed
by Ken Lambert (http://kennethalambert.com/). This is the package used by my students when they
take Introduction to Computer Science (about 40% of the AP and IB students take Intro first) 
so it makes sense to use a package with which they are already familiar. 

List of Files Needed:
Animal.java
Cage.java
ContagionSimulation.java
Display.java
Gazelle.java
HungryLion.java
Lion.java
Person.java
Position.java
Predator.java
Prey.java
Rabbit.java
SmartGazelle.java
TheGUIPart.java
ZooSimulation.java

You will also need to install the BreezyGUI and add it to the project build path. 

If you want to run the main Zoo Simulation, use ZooSimulation.java as your main class.
If you want to run the Contagion Simulation, use ContagionSimulation.java as your main class.
